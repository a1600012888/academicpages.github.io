I am an incoming master student in Robotics Institue at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I finished my undergraduate in School of EECS at Peking University, majoring in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). I spent two years of my undergraduate life at [Megvii Inc.(Face++)](https://megvii.com) as a research intern mentored by [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Later I joined Microsoft Research Asia as a research intern.  


**Research topics**
* Visual recognitaion.
* Visual content creation/editing. 
* Autonomous Driving.
* Understanding the prior of current deep learning models.
