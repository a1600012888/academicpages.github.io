I am a last-year undergradutate in School of EECS at Peking University, majoring in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). I have been a research intern at [Megvii Inc.(Face++)](https://megvii.com)    mentored by [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) since March, 2018. 

This winter, I will apply for Ph.D.

**Research topics**
* Visual recognitaion, Image manipulation.
* Model accleration(Inference).
* Dynamic networks.
* Understanding the prior of current deep learning models.
